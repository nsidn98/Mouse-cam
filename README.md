# Mouse cam
Running a computer mouse using gestures(computer vision). <br/>
Opencv is used to track a yellow colored oblect on our finger and the motion of that object determines the position of the mouse pointer on the screen(`object_movement.py`).<br/>
`mouse.py`,`Pushbutton-4_updated.ino`,`Mouse_Gyro_ENG.ino` are the codes to control the mouse using MPU-6050 sensor and arduino along with some push-buttons
